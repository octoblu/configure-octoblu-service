# configure-octoblu-service

if you have this lame thing installed called muxblu and up to date, this script is pretty easy.

if you don't know what that is, you'll need to provide most parameters.

### install

```bash
npm install --global configure-octoblu-service
```

### run

```bash
configure-octoblu-service --subdomain=bacon --project-name=bacon
```
